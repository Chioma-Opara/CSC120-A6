Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I love the concept! I think it makes proramming much cleaner and faster, as I don't have to repeat or copy and paste code from one file to another. For large projects with many files, it should help keep track of how all the files are related
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried aadding scanners to allow for greater interaction between a user and my code, but kept running into bugs ): 
However, doing that made it much easier to complete the homework when I moved those additional features to a different branch.
Again, office hours were extremely helpful in completing this assignment.
Advie to future students: Make sure to ask about concepts that seem squishy as you work through the assignment. It helps the concepts stick further. Right down the answers you get too so that you can go back to them later on.
